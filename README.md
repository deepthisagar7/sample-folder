# textimagegenerator

Library for easily creating images (PNG/JPG) which contain text-data, making those data harder to copy then regular HTML.

This project provides a Java API for creating images/graphics with text-based content.
The image can be saved in several formats (png,jpg etc.). Fonts, styles and colors can be
chosen for the text being rendered. See the src/test/nl/jamiecraane/imagegenerator/examples
packages for numerous examples of how to use this library.

For an actual example see my blogpost about this project at http://jcraane.blogspot.com/2009/01/text-image-generator-example.html

To use this library just add downloaded jar file to your projects classpath.
This project has minimal dependencies on external libraries (see pom.xml). The distributable can be found under downloads.
This jar is compatible with Java 5 or higher. A 1.4 compatible version is planned.
